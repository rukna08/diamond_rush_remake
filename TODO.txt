--- Make a list for holding the lists of game entities.

Ex: entities [] = [ stones, walls, back_walls, diamonds, grasses ]

Now we can pass the entities list to all the arrays instead
of individually doing checks and creating functions of doing
basic things for each new entity.





--- Create a GUI Panel for displaying sprites of game entities in the engine mode.
