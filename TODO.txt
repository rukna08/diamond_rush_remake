--- Make a list for holding the lists of game entities.

	Ex: entities [] = [ stones, walls, back_walls, diamonds, grasses ]

	Now we can pass the entities list to all the arrays instead
	of individually doing checks and creating functions of doing
	basic things for each new entity.

--- Make Serialisation System for Engine Stuff.
	Ex: Save the starting_x for side panel of the engine.
