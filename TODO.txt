--- Make a list for holding the lists of game entities.

Ex: entities [] = [ stones, walls, back_walls, diamonds, grasses ]

Now we can pass the entities list to all the arrays instead
of individually doing checks and creating functions of doing
basic things for each new entity.






--- Create a sprite change mechanism in the engine mode.

There should be an array of sprites which will be accessed using
the Enum called Game Entity's Values as Indices.

int index = Game_Entity::STONE;
currently_selected_sprite = sprite_array[index];

We will use <--- & ---> (left and right) arrow keys to increment
or decrement the index value.
If the index value gets more than the length of sprite_array
then we will set it to 0.
Now, why would we want to link the Enum and the index value?

When in the later development of this particular feature,
we have a GUI for selecting a particular tile, we will have
an index number in that GUI element corresponding to the
Game_Entity Enum. Also, we can directly choose to select any
sprite using the enum value through code if necessary for debug
purposes. If this is seen as an unnecessary over-complication
in the future then we should simply keep an integer index.









--- Create a GUI Panel for displaying sprites of game entities in the engine mode.
